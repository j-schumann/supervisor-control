<h2>Supervisor-Control</h2>

<p>
    Do you really want to restart the Supervisor process?<br />
    This soft restarts the Supervisor daemon. If any processes are running, they are
    automatically killed without warning. Note that the actual UNIX process for
    Supervisor cannot restart; only Supervisorâ€™s main program loop. This has the effect of
    resetting the internal states of Supervisor.  Unlike most other methods, if Supervisor
    is in the FATAL state, this will still function.
